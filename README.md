An online platform to play Fighting Fantasy esque roleplaying campaigns one-on-one.

My goals are to:

* learn MEAN stack development with Angular 2
* learn web socket usage
* create an easy way to play this specific roleplaying game when you can't schedule a live session.

The client folder contains the Angular 2 app:

* npm install
* ng build (with angular-cli)

The server folder contains the backend API, database and web server:

* npm install
* npm start / npm run startdebug

A mongoDB server is required.
